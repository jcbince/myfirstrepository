# Git on the command line 

We cna use the git version control directly from the command line. Here are some useful cammands to get started

- `git status` - This will give you the the current status of your git repository

- `git add` - Use this commmand to "stage" all of your current changes sothat they are ready to be commited

- `git commit -m "Your Message"` -This command will take all of your staged changes and create a snapshot of the current state of your repository. Using commmits is how we generate a  **commit history**  for our repository

- `git pull` - Use this command to grab any changes from your remote repository (eg, GitHub) and pull them down to your local repository(the one on your computer)

- `git push` - This command will take whatever commits you have on your computer and push them to the remor repository on GitHub.com

- `git add .` - adds any NEW changes that are unstaged.

There will be many other things to record as notes for shorcuts with git or version control
