- `git commit -m "Your Message"` -This command will take all of your staged changes and create a snapshot of the current state of your repository. Using commmits is how we generate a  **commit history**  for our repository

- `git pull` - Use this command to grab any changes from your remote repository (eg, GitHub) and pull them down to your local repository(the one on your computer)

- `git push` - This command will take whatever commits you have on your computer and push them to the remor repository on GitHub.com

- `git add .` - adds any NEW changes that are unstaged.

There are a lot of things to learn when it comes to working with git, but these commands are the day-to-day ones that you will do as you work with version control.
